## Contributing

Thanks for your interest into contributing to Cryb!
We want to keep things properly sorted, so we have some guidelines that must be followed,
either if you are having an issue, or want to contribute anyhow.

### I want to report a bug

- Look at the open and closed issues to see if it has been reported before. If not, feel free to open a new issue.
- If you think you discovered a security vulnerability, **do not open a public issue on GitHub.**
  Please follow the guidelines in our [SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md) instead.

### I want to contribute to the code

- Make sure to discuss your ideas with everyone, either via an issue, or via [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/xdhEgD5).
- Take a look at the open issues labeled as `help wanted` if you want to help without having a specific idea in mind.
- Please follow our [Code Style](https://github.com/crybapp/library/blob/master/code-style/README.md).
- Make sure that your PRs do not contain unnecessary commits or merge commits.
  [Squash commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) whenever possible.
- Your Pull Request will be then reviewed by someone from the team.
